        <li><strong>Programming Career: Simple Needs for Programming Basics</strong>
            <p>
                A lot of way to learn programming language. In following outline, I tell about basic needs
                before start learn programming to who never been used computer.

                <li><strong>Connecting Network</strong>
                    <p>
                        Before you learn programming language, you need to connect network to your computer.
                        Only then you can use relevant application for programming on your computer. The ways of
                        connect network are shown follow.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Connecting Network with Wi-Fi</strong></li>
                        <p>
                            If you have wi-fi, you can connect wi-fi to your computer. I will explain step by step how
                            to
                            connect Wi-fi.

                            <strong>Connecting to Wi-Fi network using Taskbar</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            1. Click the <strong>Network</strong> icon in the bottom-right corner of the taskbar. <br>
                            2. Select the wireless network to connect. <br>
                            3. (Optional) Check the <strong>Connect automatically</strong> option. <br>
                            4. Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button. <br>

                            5. Confirm the network security key (password).<br>
                            <img src="./asset/image/Screenshot (22).png" alt="picture of network"> <br>
                            6. Click the <strong>Next</strong> button.<br>
                            7. Confirm whether the device should be discoverable in the network by other PCs.<br>
                            If you do not find network icon, there have another way.<br><br>
                            <strong>Connecting to Wi-Fi network using Setting</strong><br><br>
                            1. Open <strong>Settings</strong>.<br>
                            2. Click on <strong>Network & Security</strong>.<br>
                            3. Click on <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.<br>
                            4. Click the <strong>Manage known networks</strong> option.<br>
                            <img src="./asset/image/Screenshot (18).png" alt="picture of network"> <br>
                            5. Click the <strong>Add a new network</strong> button.<br>

                            8. Confirm the network security key (password).<br>
                            <img src="./asset/image/Screenshot (20).png" alt="picture of network"> <br>
                            9. Check the <strong>Connect automatically</strong> option.<br>
                            10. Check the Connect even if this network is not broadcasting option (if required).<br>
                            11. Click the <strong>Save</strong> button.<br>
                            Once you complete the steps, the laptop will connect to the network using the Wi-Fi
                            connection.
                        </p>
                        <li><strong>Connecting Network with Phone</strong></li>
                        <p>
                            If you don’t have Wi-fi, you can connect network from your phone to computer.
                            Connecting network with phone require one more step than connecting with computer as
                            shown below. <br>
                            1. On your phone, open the Settings app and then tap Personal Hotspot. <br>
                            2. Just below the slider button you will see password for your smartphone’s hotspot. If you
                            want to change password tap it. <br>
                            3. The phone automatically uses the device name as the hotpot name. <br>
                            4. Open the computer and connect network with your device name (connecting is the same
                            like wi-fi connecting).
                        </p>

                <li><strong>Learning English is Importing Part of a Programming Basics</strong></li>
                <p>
                    English is not essential but it is important for learning programming basics. Most
                    documentation, references and anything at all related to programming will be in English. Many of
                    4
                    the languages themselves use English terminology and a huge amount of the documentation,
                    tutorials, videos, etc... are in English. So, if you do not know English, you are cutting yourself
                    off
                    from a huge amount of learning resources. The keywords of many programming languages are in
                    English, so not knowing English would make it slightly harder to learn. It would be harder to get
                    sample code and answers to questions without knowing English. Not only to learn programming,
                    but also to access the knowledge written in English, you should learn English.
