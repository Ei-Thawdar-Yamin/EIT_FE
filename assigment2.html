    <strong>Programming Career: Simple Needs for Programming Basics</strong>
    <p>
        A lot of ways to learn programming language. In the following outline, I explain about basic needs to
        people who have never used computers before they start to learn programming.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Connecting to a Network</strong>
            <p>
                Before you learn a programming language, you need to connect your computer to a network.
                Only then, you can use a relevant application for programming on your computer. The Ways of
                connecting to a network are shown as follow.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Connecting to a Wi-Fi Network</strong></li>
                <p>
                    If you have Wi-Fi, you can connect Wi-Fi to your computer. I explain step by step how
                    to
                    connect Wi-Fi.
                    <br><br>
                    <strong>Connecting to a Wi-Fi network using Taskbar</strong>
                    <br><br>
                    1. Click the <strong>Network</strong> icon in the bottom-right corner of the taskbar. <br>
                    2. Select a wireless network to connect. <br>
                    3. (Optional) Check the <strong>Connect automatically</strong> option. <br>
                    4. Click the <strong>Connect</strong> button. <br>

                    5. Confirm the network security key (password).<br>
                    <img src="./asset/image/Screenshot (22).png" alt="picture of network"> <br>
                    6. Click the <strong>Next</strong> button.<br>
                    7. Confirm whether the device should be discoverable in the network by other PCs.<br>
                    If you do not find network icon, there is another way.<br><br>
                    <strong>Connecting to a Wi-Fi network using Settings</strong><br><br>
                    1. Open <strong>Settings</strong>.<br>
                    2. Click on <strong>Network & Security</strong>.<br>
                    3. Click on <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.<br>
                    4. Click the <strong>Manage known networks</strong> option.<br>
                    <img src="./asset/image/Screenshot (18).png" alt="picture of network"> <br>
                    5. Click the <strong>Add a new network</strong> button.<br>
                    <img src="./asset/image/Screenshot (19).png" alt="picture of network"> <br>
                    6. Confirm the name of the network.<br>
                    7. Use the drop-down menu to select the <strong>Security type</strong> – For
                    example,<strong> WPA2-Personal AES</strong>.<br>
                    8. Confirm the network security key (password).<br>
                    <img src="./asset/image/Screenshot (20).png" alt="picture of network"> <br>
                    9. Check the <strong>Connect automatically</strong> option.<br>
                    10. Check the Connect even if this network is not broadcasting option (if required).<br>
                    11. Click the <strong>Save</strong> button.<br>
                    Once you complete the steps, the laptop will connect to the network using the Wi-Fi
                    connection.
                </p>
                <li><strong>Connecting Network with a Smartphone</strong></li>
                <p>
                    If you don’t have Wi-fi, you can connect your computer to a network through your phone.
                    Connecting to a network via a phone requires the following steps before connecting a
                    computer as
                    shown below. <br>
                    1. On your phone, open the Settings app and then tap Personal Hotspot. <br>
                    2. Just below the slider button you will see password for your smartphone’s hotspot. If you
                    want to change password tap it. <br>
                    3. The phone automatically uses the device name as the hotspot name. <br>
                    4. Open the computer and connect network with your device name (connecting is by the same
                    way like Wi-Fi connection).
                </p>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Learning English is Important Part of Programming Basics</strong></li>
        <p>
            English is not essential but it is important for learning programming basics. Most
            documents, references and anything at all related to programming are written in English. Many of
            the languages themselves use English terminology ,a huge amount of the documentation,
            tutorials, videos, etc... are in English. So, if you do not know English, you miss a huge amount of
            learning resources. The keywords of many programming languages are in
            English. Thus, not knowing English would make it harder to learn. It would be harder to get
            sample code and answers to questions without knowing English. Not only to learn programming,
            but also to access the knowledge written in English, you should learn English.
