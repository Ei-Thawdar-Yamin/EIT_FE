    <p>
        There’s an air of desperation among tech employers this summer.
        Software talent, it seems, is in such high demand that companies are morphing
        how they hire. And workers are the ones with the power. U.S. tech salaries are
        also on the rise. A recent <ins>Dice</ins> Dice report found tech jobs saw an average salary
        increase of 3.6% between late 2019 and late 2020. That might not sound like
        much, but it’s a significant jump compared with 2017, 2018 and 2019, when
        annual increases were less than 1%. While many technologists would still prefer
        to work 100% remotely, there is an equal desire for a hybrid approach, and
        we’ve actually seen fewer remote days per week become more desirable over the
        past year. The companies who succeed in attracting and retaining top talent will
        be those who take the time to build an agile approach that gives technologists
        flexibility and control over their work environment. It is a worker’s market, and
        employees are acting like consumers in how they are consuming work — seeking
        flexibility, competitive pay and fast decisions. Now is the time for employers to
        get creative to attract talent — and to hold onto the workers they have with both
        hands.
