                    When you start to learning programming basic, you will need a computer. Both of Window
                    and MacBook can use for learning from programming basic. I prefer Window than MacBook
                    because Window is a little bit easy to use for me. But you can use what you like.

                    Before you start learning programming, you need to set up IDE in your computer. I
                    recommend Visual Studio Code as a best free IDE. There have a lot of IDEs, you can choose what
                    you like. If you want to know more, watch the following link.

                    English is the standard language in Technical communication so you should learn about
                    English language at least. If you are proficient in English, it much better. There is two ways for
                    learning programming, they are self-study and programming class.
                    If you want to learning your-self, I want to recommend you learn only one youtuber who
                    teach programming in online. Teaching methods vary from person to person so that you can
                    confuse.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are learning for start now, don’t study your-self because technical tern different
                    to English. It is no matter if your proficient in English but if you not you should attend
                    programming class. If you know about programming, you should learn it your-self.
                    <br><br>
                    It is important to remember that yes programming can be intimidating at first, but if you
                    start to feel demotivated or overwhelmed just know that every developer has felt that way at
                    least once in their career but has managed to work through it. The best tip we can give you is to
                    try embrace the uncertainty and persevere!
