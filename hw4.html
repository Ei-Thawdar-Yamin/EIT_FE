    <h2><ins>The best website/platform for “Competitive programming”</ins></h2>
    <p>
        I suggest “Exercism” as the best website/platform for “Competitive
        programming”. There are 3,173 exercises in 51 languages to enhance
        your programming skills. It starts off with language tracks that allow
        users to choose their preferred languages. We can choose the language
        that we are good at. Moreover, there are human mentors who will check
        your code and help you improve as you progress. This makes the
        platform perfect for total beginners who want to deepen their
        understanding of a new programming language.
