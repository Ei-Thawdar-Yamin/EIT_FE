    <h2>“Best Theme of WordPress for a Website of Small Business” </h2>
    <p>
        According to the following link, Divi from Elegant themes is a top WordPress theme
        with lots of handy functions. It is great pick if you want full control over your website but does
        not know about web design or code. Part of that popularity comes from Divi’s excellent built-in
        drag and drop builder that you can use to create any layout for your site.
