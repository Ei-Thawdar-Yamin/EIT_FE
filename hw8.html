                    When you start to learning programming basic, you will need a computer. Both of Window
                    and MacBook can use for learning from programming basic. I prefer Window than MacBook
                    because Window is a little bit easy to use for me. But you can use what you like.

                    Before you start learning programming, you need to set up IDE in your computer. I

                    you like. If you want to know more, watch the following link.

                    English is the standard language in Technical communication so you should learn about
                    English language at least. If you are proficient in English, it much better. There is two ways for
                    learning programming, they are self-study and programming class.
                    If you want to learning your-self, I want to recommend you learn only one youtuber who
                    teach programming in online. Teaching methods vary from person to person so that you can
                    confuse.
                    <br><br>
                    If you are learning for start now, don’t study your-self because technical tern different
                    to English. It is no matter if your proficient in English but if you not you should attend
                    programming class. If you know about programming, you should learn it your-self.

                    It is important to remember that yes programming can be intimidating at first, but if you
                    start to feel demotivated or overwhelmed just know that every developer has felt that way at
                    least once in their career but has managed to work through it. The best tip we can give you is to
                    try embrace the uncertainty and persevere!

                    HTML means hypertext markup language, a formatting system for displaying material
                    retrieved over the Internet. HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML
                    use to create pages and make them functional. Do not use Microsoft Word or any other word
                    processor when writing HTML code, only an HTML editor is suitable for the task. Install browsers
                    such as Chrome or Firefox in order to preview your upcoming.
                    What are Tags and Attributes?
                    Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.
                    They work together but perform different functions – it is worth investing 2 minutes in
                    differentiating the two.
                    What Are HTML Tags?
                    Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle
                    brackets. An example of a tag is:
                <h1>.
                    Most tags must be opened <h1> and closed </h1> in order to function.
                    What are HTML Attributes?
                    Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag
                    and additional info is placed inside.
                    An example of an attribute is:
                    <img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog.">
                    In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the <img> tag.
