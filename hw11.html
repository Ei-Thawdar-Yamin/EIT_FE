    <h2>The best way to create Website for SME(Small and mid-size Enterprise)</h2>

    <p>
        Once you have a clear direction of what you want your website to accomplish, you can
        start digging into the process of designing and building it. Here are seven key steps to help you
        launch your business’ online presence.

    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Choose your website bulding platform</li>
        <p>
            Ideally, you should opt for a user-friendly solution that will help you create a website
            without any coding knowledge. Here’s what we recommend for small businesses:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>WordPress.</strong> There are two versions of WordPress. We will focus on WordPress.org,
                which gives you access to the best features and full control over your website. You’ll
                need to arrange hosting separately (more on that later).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Hosted website builders.</strong> If you like all-in-one solutions, you might want to consider
                a reputable website builder such as Squarespace or Wix. These platforms offer complete
                website designs out of the box, which you can customize with a drag-and-drop tool.
            </li>
        </ul>
        The costs associated with hosted website builders depend on the plan you choose. On
        the other hand, WordPress is an open-source project, which means it’s free for you to use.
        However, you will be responsible for finding a web hosting provider, which is an additional
        expense.
        </p>

        <li>Pick Your domain name</li>
        <p>
            Your domain name should ideally align with your business name.Here are some tips to take into
            account when deciding on your website address:
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure it’s easy to spell.</li>
            <li>Keep it as short as possible.</li>
            <li>Include keywords relevant to your business.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <li>Find your hosting provider</li>
        <p>
            If you decided to go with an all-in-one website builder, you can skip this step. WordPress
            users should keep reading. There are several excellent beginner-friendly hosting companies you
            can consider. Our top pick is Bluehost, which is officially recommended by WordPress.org: The
            2
            cheapest Basic plan starts at just $2.75 per month. This package is usually sufficient for small
            websites, but you can easily upgrade as your business grows. Bluehost features an intuitive
            dashboard and one-click WordPress installation.
        </p>

        <li>Select a theme or template</li>
        <p>
            WordPress and Squarespace offer tons of templates (or themes) that you can easily
            customize. Many of them are free to use, too. In WordPress, you can access free theme options
            from your dashboard by navigating to Appearance > Themes: <br><br>
            Once you Install and Activate the theme of your choice, you’ll be able to customize it.
            Alternatively, you may want to consider a premium WordPress business theme. These products
            often include features such as pre-built portfolios, eCommerce pages, and page
            builder integration. On the other hand, Squarespace lists all its templates directly on its site.
            You’ll land straight in the editing area, where you can customize almost all your site’s elements.
        </p>

        <li>Add your content</li>
        <p>
            As you customize your website, you will likely want to add content almost immediately.
            Before you do that, it’s wise to have a rough structure in mind. Most business websites will need
            the following:

        <ul>
            <li><strong> Homepage.</strong> This will be the first thing many visitors see when they come to your site.
                It
                should give a short overview of your services and include clear navigation to other
                sections.</li>
            <li><strong>Products, Services, or Portfolio page.</strong> This is where you will showcase your work and
                describe what you have to offer customers or clients.</li>
            <li><strong>About page.</strong> In this section, you’ll include your story or share information about your
                team.</li>
            <li><strong>Contact page.</strong> Ideally, you’ll want to include a contact form and encourage customers to
                get in touch if they have questions.</li>
            <li><strong> Blog.</strong> This is a must for many businesses nowadays and an excellent content
                marketing tool.</li>
        </ul>

        WordPress and popular website builders such as Squarespace and Wix all enable you to easily
        create pages and add blog posts.
        </p>

        <li>Optimize your website for search engine</li>
        <p>
            Once you have content available online, you still have to make sure people can find it. Search
            engine optimization (SEO) is one strategy that can help with that. SEO is the practice of refining
            3
            your content so that it is more likely to rank high on search engine results pages (SERPs). There
            are a few key practices that you should keep in mind, such as:

        <ul>
            <li>Using appropriate keywords in your posts and pages</li>
            <li>Optimizing your website for speed</li>
            <li>Picking a responsive design so that your content works on all devices</li>
            <li>Including internal and external links throughout your site</li>
            <li>Using post names in their permalinks</li>
        </ul>

        If you chose WordPress as your website platform, you can install an SEO plugin such as Yoast
        SEO, which scans your content and suggests tips for improvement. Some website builders offer
        similar tools. However, it’s always smart to follow this SEO checklist.
        </p>

        <li>Publishyour website</li>
        <p>
            Many website builders enable you to keep your site private while you’re building it, then
            publish once it’s ready for visitors. With WordPress, your site will be visible to the public as soon
            as you’ve installed the WordPress software on your hosting account. Regardless, before you start
            promoting your website, there are a few last-minute checks you might want to make:

        <ul>
            <li>Preview how your website will look on mobile devices to make sure it’s readable.</li>
            <li>Read through your content to make sure everything is accurate.</li>
            <li>Remove any filler content from your theme or template.</li>
        </ul>

        In order to start driving traffic to your new site, you might consider reaching out to existing
        customers to let them know you’re now online. You can also promote it on social media or via
        email.
